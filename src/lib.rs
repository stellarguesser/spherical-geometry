//! # Spherical Geometry
//!
//! `spherical_geometry` is a library for handling geometry on the surface of a sphere.
//!
//! This library combines spherical and vector geometry to perform operations with points, [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle), great circle arcs... A great circle is an equivalent of a straight line in planar geometry - it is the shortest path between two points on a sphere.

//! If it is not obvious how to use a function and there is not an example in the documentation, please open an issue/pull request in the repository. In the meantime before it gets added, you can try to take a look at the unit tests, which usually show how to use a function, which can serve as an example.
